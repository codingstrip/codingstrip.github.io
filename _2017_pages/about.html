          <i>"Can you write code that illustrates the above comics? Or guess at high-level what computing concepts were used in the comics?"</i>
        </blockquote>

        <p>CodingStrip is a research project conducted by research team at the University of Waterloo. The starting point of this project is this question: "how can we leverage a medium of comics to teach computing concepts?"</p>

        <p>The project is motivated by two main observations:

        <ul>
          <li>Comics is a fun, effective form of communication, especially for teaching abstract concepts.</li>
          <li>Comics publications on computer science does not tie computing concepts back to code, preventing effective learning transfer.</li>
        </ul>
         </p>

        <p>
          
        </p>

        <h2 class="third">Why?</h2>

        <p>Computing concepts are often introduced with abstract represetation, code. But the syntax complexities in code can (1) scare students, and (2) distract them from understanding a given concept. </p>
