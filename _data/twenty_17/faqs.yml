- question: Is this workshop for research?
  answer: Yes, it is! So we will need your consent to participate in the study. Please note that our session will be video recorded. However, you are also free to participate in our workshop without participating in the research. This means, we will not be reporting your data.

- question: Do I need to know all the algorithms?
  answer: No, you do not. As long as you have some experience with programming, the workshop is open to anyone. You will also work in groups, so you may find more knowledgeable team members who can assist you. Also, you can look up the concepts from the Internet, if needed.
