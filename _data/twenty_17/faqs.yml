- question: Is this workshop for research?
  answer: Yes, it is! So we will need your consent to participate in the study. However, you are also free to participate in our workshop without participating in the research. This means, we will not be collecting your data.

- question: Do I need to know the algorithms for the workshop?
  answer: No, you do not. As long as you have some experience with programming, you can participate in our workshop. You will also work in groups, so you will not be alone. We will provide you with any information you need about the computing concepts so that you can focus on the design of comics.
